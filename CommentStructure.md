Notes to use for future IC reference...

pay attention to method names and interaction patterns.

Used symbols but test looks like it was strictly calling for "string" and integer for the passenger attributes.

Flat_map was correct call. Test again with added passengers to properly test combining the arrays.

Unique name was called for in paragraph but name was called for in functionality table in Park Method Name Value.

&: usage is correct but maybe next time just use {|word| } or class taught syntax as   
do | | 
end
until further mods

Look into @park vs @zion. Each park couldve been generated by changing name inside the attribute givens. @park = "zion" instead of @zion = zion 

leave => instead of changing to : in given test pattern for passengers etc

pay attention to initializing 

Certain things look like they were not supposed to be generated in the initialize. 

Also passengers Method Name value called for passengers and not Attendees. All_attendees looks like it was strictly a method call further into Iteration 4 and not to be intiialized early on.
